This is a team effort game built from HTML, CSS, and Javacript.

Our assignment outline was as follows: 
 - The gameplay should go back and forth between an enemy and the player, each inflicting damage on the other when they launch a successful attack.
 - There should be multiple player types.
 - There should be multiple enemy types.
 - You should be able to select the player type from a dropdown.
 - The enemy type should be randomly generated.
 - The player should manually select the "Fight" action to attack.
 - The enemy should automatically attack when it is its turn.
 - You should use classes for the players and enemies.
 - The player's health should be visible.
 - The enemies health may be visible, at your discretion.

Our game is inspired by Pokemon but with a food fight theme. The selected hero has two different actions they can choose from:
- Attacking
- Eating

The player can choose whether they would like to attack with the current food in their hand, or to eat it to regain health.
Each of the three different characters the player can choose from have varying levels of health and attack damage multipliers.
